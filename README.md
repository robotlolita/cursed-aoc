# Cursed AoC

Advent of Code, but I can only use TypeScript's type system to solve the puzzles. And yes, the inputs are also parsed by the type system :>

## Running this

You'll need:

1. A Python3 interpreter --- look for Python files in this repo if you're curious about the **why** of that!;
2. Node.js; and
3. Unwavering faith in whatever gods you believe in :>

Once you've managed to gather all ingredients^W requisites, you can run:

    npm run build
    npm run type-check

If it compiles, then all of the code is correct. If it doesn't? Well, good luck.

## Note

All of the puzzles will only solve the _example input_. Sadly trying to apply this to the real puzzle inputs is just going to make your computer cry.
